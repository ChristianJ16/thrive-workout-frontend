# Description
Thrive Workout is an interactive fitness planning app designed to help users create personalized workout routines. Users can select exercises from an extensive library, each detailed with step-by-step instructions, targeted muscles/body parts, and an accompanying GIF/video to ensure correct form. The app allows users to compile these exercises into custom workouts, similar to creating themed boards on Pinterest. This makes it easy to organize and access routines tailored to different fitness goals.
